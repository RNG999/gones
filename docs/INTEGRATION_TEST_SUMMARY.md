# NES Emulator Integration Test Suite

## Overview

This comprehensive integration test suite validates the interaction between all major components of the NES emulator, ensuring proper timing, synchronization, and data flow between the CPU, PPU, memory, and I/O systems. The tests follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and are designed to initially fail (red phase) until the full emulator implementation is complete.

### Integration Test Philosophy
- **System-Level Validation**: Tests entire component interaction chains
- **Timing-Critical Testing**: Validates cycle-accurate emulation requirements
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Realistic Workloads**: Uses NES-like programs and access patterns

## Expected Test Outcomes (TDD Red Phase)

Currently, all tests should **FAIL** because:
1. Component interfaces may not be fully implemented
2. Timing synchronization is not yet cycle-accurate
3. DMA implementation may be incomplete
4. NMI generation and handling may not be implemented
5. Memory mirroring may not be fully functional
6. Frame timing may not be precise

## Implementation Guidance

### To Move to TDD Green Phase:
1. **Implement Missing Interfaces**: Ensure all component interfaces are fully implemented
2. **Add Cycle Tracking**: Implement precise cycle counting in CPU and PPU
3. **Implement DMA**: Add OAM DMA with proper CPU suspension and timing
4. **Add NMI Generation**: Implement VBlank NMI generation in PPU
5. **Complete Memory Mirroring**: Implement all memory mirroring modes
6. **Add Frame Timing**: Implement precise NTSC timing with odd frame skip

### Key Integration Points:
- **Bus Coordination**: Ensure proper component step coordination (CPU:PPU 1:3 ratio)
- **Memory Interface**: Complete memory map with proper mirroring
- **Interrupt System**: Link PPU VBlank to CPU NMI handling
- **DMA System**: Implement cycle-accurate OAM DMA
- **Timing Precision**: Ensure all operations are cycle-accurate

## Test Execution
